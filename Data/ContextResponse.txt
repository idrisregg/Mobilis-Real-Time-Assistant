Mobilis – Support Context

Mobilis (ATM Mobilis) is Algeria’s state-owned leading mobile operator, launched in 2002. It offers voice calls and SMS, high-speed mobile data (3G/4G/4G+), and extensive network coverage across Algeria

. Mobilis uses unified “Mobilis Units” (MU) for its Revolution prepaid/postpaid plans: calls (5 MU/min), SMS (10 MU each), and data (50 MU per GB) all draw from the same balance. Many prepaid plans include extras like free Facebook access (unlimited or after quota) during the plan validity

.

Prepaid/Postpaid Plans: “Revolution” plans let you bundle credit for calls, SMS and data

. Prepaid users can renew or upgrade via the *600# menu or the MobiSpace app. Postpaid (“Facturé”) subscribers have similar options with monthly billing. A Control plan option limits spending to a fixed credit.

Data/Internet Plans: Mobilis offers data-centric packages. For example, Pack MobiNet bundles a 4G mobile Wi-Fi modem with a large data allowance (e.g. 200 GB valid for 9 months)

(see image above). There is also Navigui – a prepaid data-only SIM (sold at ~300 DA) with an initial 3 GB bonus (plus unlimited WhatsApp/Facebook for 30 days). You can top up data via *600#, through the MeetMob portal, or via agencies. Optional data passes (e.g. 300 MB/24h for 30 DA, 1 GB/24h for 100 DA, etc.) are purchasable through *600#, the web portal or app

.

Recharge & Payments: Prepaid recharge is done by dialing *111*<scratch-code>#

. For example, after scratching a Mobilis card to reveal the 14-digit code, dial *111*CODE# to top up. Balances and plan validity can be checked anytime with *222#. Mobilis also supports mobile payments (E‑rselli), online payment (MeetMob, e‑paiement.mobilis.dz), banking (Wimpay-BNA), and postal recharge services

.

Roaming & International: Mobilis offers international call/SMS rates and roaming packages. Call rates vary by destination; for example, calls to France start around 47.4 DA/min (landline)

. Data roaming and roaming voice/SMS can be enabled on your line – prepaid users must ensure Data Roaming is active (contact customer service if needed)

.

Customer Service: Mobilis customer care is reachable by phone and online

. Prepaid customers dial 888 (from a Mobilis line) and postpaid dial 666 to speak to an agent. Landline contacts are 0660 600 666 or 0660 600 888. Support is also available via the official website and MeetMob online portal or the MobiSpace smartphone app for account management and service activation

.

Common Problems & Troubleshooting
Connectivity Issues (connectivity)

Mobilis boasts extensive coverage (over 10,000 base stations nationwide, including ~5,000 in rural areas

) and fast 4G+ service

. However, users may still encounter signal or data issues. The assistant should guide users through basic network troubleshooting:

Internet Not Working:

Check Settings: Ensure Mobile Data is on and Airplane Mode is off on your device. Confirm you have chosen the correct network mode (e.g. automatic or LTE/3G) in your phone’s settings.

Toggle Airplane Mode: Turn on Airplane Mode briefly, then turn it off to reset the radio.

Restart Device: Power-cycle the phone to refresh the connection.

Check Data Balance: Dial *222# to make sure you still have available data or credit

.

Verify APN: Ensure the Access Point Name (APN) is set to “internet” (Mobilis’s default APN) in your network settings; incorrect APN can block data. If unsure, look up Mobilis APN (“internet”, user/pass “internet”) or reset to default.

Coverage Check: If you’re indoors or in a remote area, move to an open space. Mobilis network is generally strong, but building materials or distance can weaken signal

.

Contact Support: If data still fails to connect after these steps, the assistant should say something like: “I’m sorry you’re having trouble with mobile internet. If basic fixes haven’t helped, please contact Mobilis support (dial 888 on your Mobilis line) or visit a Mobilis agency for further assistance”

.

Slow Data Speeds:

Check Plan Limits: Ensure you have not exhausted a high-speed data bundle. Some plans throttle speeds after quota. Dial *222# to confirm how much high-speed data remains

.

Close Background Apps: Heavy apps or downloads can slow your connection. Close unused apps or pause downloads.

Switch Network Mode: If you’re in 4G mode but congestion is high, try selecting 3G only (or vice versa) in your phone’s settings as a test.

Time/Location: If many users are online (e.g. during peak hours or in crowded areas), speeds can drop. Consider trying again later or moving location.

Network Type: Ensure you are actually connected to 4G/4G+; if your device shows only 3G or 2G, try toggling LTE on/off.

Assisted Boost (if available): On some plans, dialing *622# can purchase an extra speed boost (confirm current promotions via *600# or Mobilis info).

Re-test or Contact: If speeds are consistently slow, say “Let’s check your signal bars and location. If everything looks fine but speeds remain low, please try restarting your phone or contacting Mobilis support for a coverage check.”

No Signal / “SOS Only”:

Network Selection: Check that your device is set to automatically select the Mobilis network. In settings, try manually reselecting “Mobilis” or allow auto selection.

SIM Seating: Power off and reinsert the SIM card to ensure it is properly seated.

Active SIM: Verify the SIM is still active. Prepaid SIMs unused for 120+ days can be deactivated by regulation

. (If it’s been inactive, the assistant should say: “If your SIM was inactive, you may need to go to a Mobilis store to reactivate your number.”)

Coverage: Move to a different location – high ground or near a window – in case of a local outage or weak coverage. Use the Mobilis coverage map to check if your area has service.

Device Compatibility: Confirm your phone supports GSM/LTE bands used by Mobilis. If you recently switched phones, ensure the old SIM isn’t locked to a different carrier.

Seek Support: If no signal persists, reply “I’m sorry there’s no signal here. You can try a different area or check if others on Mobilis have service nearby. If the problem continues, please contact Mobilis customer care at 888 or visit an agency to check for outages.”

.

Voice/SMS Issues:

Test Calls: If you can’t make calls or send SMS but data works, verify your plan’s call/SMS balance (via *222#).

Call Forwarding: If calls go unanswered, ensure call forwarding features (644 service) aren’t misconfigured. You can disable all forwarding with ##002#.

Blocked Numbers: Check you haven’t accidentally blocked the destination number.

Restart & Retry: Sometimes restarting the phone clears transient errors.

Contact Support: If voice/SMS still fail, advise: “Your account or SIM might have an issue. Please contact Mobilis support (888/666) for help with calls/SMS problems.”

Package Activation & Usage (packages)

Mobilis users often ask how to activate or manage bundles. The assistant should explain:

Activating Data/Voice Packages: Encourage dialing *600# to browse offers. This menu (or the MeetMob web portal/MobiSpace app

) lets users select packages. For example:

“To add an Internet pack, dial *600#, choose Internet Passes, then select 300 MB/24h or 1 GB/24h, etc. You can also visit Mobilis agencies or log into the MeetMob site for offers

.”

Package Not Activating: If a user says “I can’t activate my package,” respond:

Check Steps: Ensure they followed the correct menu prompts. Advise retrying the USSD carefully.

Sufficient Balance: Confirm they have enough credit or MU units for the package. Dial *222# to check balance

.

Account Status: If a prepaid plan just expired, the account may be locked until renewal. Advise renewing the plan via *600# or recharging.

Allow Time: Sometimes activation takes a minute; suggest waiting a short while.

Contact Support: If it still fails, say: “Let me help: Could you try activating again now? If it still doesn’t work, Mobilis support can reset or check your account.”

Renewing Plans: Prepaid plans typically auto-renew if there’s balance. Otherwise, manually renew by dialing *600# and selecting your plan. (Mobilis FAQ notes renewing via *600# at any time

.)

Combining Passes: Mobilis passes are cumulative

. If multiple passes are active, the one with the shortest validity is used first. No special action is needed; passes stack automatically.

SIM & Technical Issues (technical)

SIM Deactivated/Expired: If a user’s SIM “died” from inactivity, explain the regulation: “Prepaid SIMs with no calls/SMS/data for ~4 months are deactivated

. To recover, they must go to a Mobilis store with ID to reactivate or replace the SIM.”

SIM Locked (PIN/PUK): If the SIM is locked, say: “Enter the PUK code provided on your SIM pack. If lost, you may need to visit a Mobilis agency with ID to get a new SIM.”

New SIM No Service: When swapping to a new phone, ensure the SIM size is correct. Advise rebooting phone after SIM swap. If it still shows “no service”, check network settings as above.

APN/Settings: If the issue is internet-only, remind them to verify APN (see Connectivity section).

Device-Specific: If unknown phone model or errors persist, say: “Let’s ensure your device software is up-to-date. If your phone was just updated or replaced, double-check the APN and try rebooting again.”

Billing & Recharge Issues (billing)

Recharge Code Not Accepted:

Correct Code: Remind the user to scratch completely and enter the full 14-digit code after *111*.

Syntax: Make sure they include * before and after the code, then press Send/Call.

Confirmation: They should see a confirmation SMS of successful recharge. If not, the code may be invalid or already used.

Balance Check: After attempting, dial *222# to see if balance increased

.

Try Alternative: The assistant can suggest visiting MeetMob to enter the code online or using Mobilis E-rselli portal.

Contact Support: If still failing, advise contacting Mobilis (888) with the code and scratch card receipt.

No Credit Added: If recharge wasn’t credited, instruct them to wait a few minutes (network delay) then check. If still empty, reassure: “The agents can trace any recharge errors. Please note the code and amount, then call Mobilis support for credit restoration.”

Over-charged/Duplicate: If user sees two recharges for one code, instruct them to write down details and call support (888/666) for correction.

Roaming Issues (roaming)

No Service Abroad: Remind users to enable Data Roaming and voice roaming in their phone settings. Check that Mobilis roaming is active on their account (often needed for prepaid

).

High Charges: Alert users to roaming rates. If unexpectedly high bills occur, advise them to contact customer care. Suggest using Wi-Fi calling or local SIMs if staying long abroad.

Roaming Data Not Working: Recommend the same steps as for domestic data (check APN, restart) and verify “Data Roaming” is on. If still down, say: “It may help to set the network to automatic or to restart in the visited country. If the problem persists, call Mobilis to enable international data on your line.”
